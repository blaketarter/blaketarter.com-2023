In this regard I think React allows you to build interfaces in a way that equates with how they are designed and how we think about them intuitively. The way data flows is predictable and flexible. I love that React uses existing language features instead of inventing magic syntax.",

              Hi, I&apos;m Blake ðŸ‘‹
              <br />
              <br />
              I&apos;m a TypeScript developer with over nine years of experience
              planning, creating, and maintaining various types of apps and
              websites. My current weapons of choice include React, Next,
              TypeScript, and Node. I spend my days building enterprise-grade
              web apps, consumer facing websites, and mobile apps. I kick back
              on my nights and weekends by honing my skills and working on
              passion projects.
              <br />
              <br />
              Currently I work at Crema, a product agency that partners with
              funded startups and existing brands to create technology solutions
              and new digital ventures. I also do some freelance work in my
              spare time with Midwestern Originals.

              I don&apos;t have experience in something, here are some things
