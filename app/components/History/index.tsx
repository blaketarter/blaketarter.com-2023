            <p>
              I&apos;ve had an interesting journey to get me to where I am now.
              Originally I set out to be a graphic designer, then switched to
              web design in college, and then eventually realized web
              development was my true passion. While growing up, I was always
              interested in computers and took as much time as I could to teach
              myself programming and design. I&apos;ve learned I have a passion
              to create and problem solve; web development is a perfect
              culmination of these two things. <br />
              <br />
              My career so far has taken me from startup to agency. Using a
              myriad of different technologies, frameworks, and methodologies
              I&apos;ve built everything from web applications to marketing
              websites, hybrid and native applications, and then back again.
              Currently I find myself working on web and native applications
              using React and TypeScript as well as the occasional freelance
              website.
